# Project Title

Old BASIC programs from Compute Magazine

## Getting Started

Compute was a home computing magazine publication which ran from 1979 - 1994.  
Originally focused on the Commodore PET home computer, it grew to cover the
vast majority of home computing platforms by the mid 1980s.   

### Prerequisites

The programs here were originally written for PC-DOS BASIC the IBM PC/PCjr.
A majority run successfully on PC-BASIC interpreter (http://pc-basic.org)
on modern hardware and Windows.  However, many of the more complex programs
appear to only work on the original PC-DOS BASIC interpreter.
